      <h3>Professional Background</h3>
      <p>Iâ€™m a product-minded tech leader with over 17 years of experience building teams and products in B2B and B2C SaaS, FinTech, Hospitality, and Media & Entertainment.</p>
      <p>I started in finance, building software and algorithmic trading strategies, then moved to startups to drive innovation from the ground upâ€”launching solutions like Latin Americaâ€™s first robo-advisory platform at <a href="https://www.monetar.com.br/">Monetar</a>, where I built from 0 to 1, growing the client base and assets under management before its acquisition by GeraÃ§Ã£o Futuro.</p>
      <p>At <a href="https://actabl.com/alice/">ALICE</a>, a B2B SaaS startup, I scaled a team by 10x during rapid growth from 1 to 10, paving the way for its acquisition by ASG from Expedia Group.</p>
      <p>At <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon</a>, I led 50+ person cross-functional teams to deliver global systems driving hundreds of millions in revenue. At Prime Video, I currently oversee partner-facing products used by 18,000+ studios worldwide to acquire, engage, and retain users, while providing them with data analytics and insights to understand their business.</p>

      <h3>LinkedIn and Publications</h3>
      <p>On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelcn/">LinkedIn</a>, I often share ideas on topics like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7253192464092573696/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7253192464092573696%29">First Principles Thinking</a> and the importance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7257013312385646593/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7257013312385646593%29">asking the right questions</a>.</p> 
      <p>In addition to these LinkedIn ideas, Iâ€™ve also published articles on <a href="https://medium.com/@rafael.neves/7-things-i-learned-scaling-a-global-engineering-team-8d8be698986f">scaling global teams</a>, <a href="https://devops.com/an-inconvenient-truth-about-devops/">DevOps</a>, and <a href="https://highscalability.com/how-to-build-your-property-management-system-integration-usi/">distributed architectures</a>.</p>
      <p>I also contributed a guest post on the <a href="https://raddougall.com/blog/enabling-warm-reception/">intersection of technology and hospitality</a>.</p>

      <h3>Technical Interests</h3>
      <p>I explore new technologies and experiment with topics Iâ€™m passionate about on <a href="https://github.com/rcarvalhosa">GitHub</a>, including game development and neural networks.</p>

      <h3>Current Focus</h3>
      <p>Iâ€™m deeply immersed in machine learning and GenAI, exploring books, online courses, and video series while building my own neural networks with PyTorch.</p>
      <p>Alongside this, my teams at Amazon are actively developing GenAI-driven features, one of which I recently presented at an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7259796020224540673/">AI event</a>.</p>
